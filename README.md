Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be accessed from Kaggle. It consists of MRI images of brain tumors categorized into classes for supervised learning.

Working Procedure
This project focuses on a comparative analysis of five state-of-the-art deep learning models to classify brain tumors. The models evaluated are:

VGG16
VGG19
GoogleNet
ResNet50
DenseNet121
Each model's performance is evaluated based on key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results
Training Accuracies:
Epoch_vs_accuracies (Train)

Validation Accuracies:
Epoch_vs_accuracies (Val)

Packages Used:
numpy opencv tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
