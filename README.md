This repository contains the implementation, experiments, and analysis for the research paper:

“Multi-Class Brain Tumour Classification with CNN on MRI Scans”,
published in the IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Information, Communication and Systems (SPICSCON 2024).

The work focuses on applying transfer learning–based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify brain tumors from MRI scans.

📌 Abstract

Accurate classification of brain tumors using MRI scans is a challenging task due to complex tumor structures and variations in medical imaging. Manual diagnosis is time-consuming and prone to human error, motivating the adoption of Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems.

This study evaluates five widely used transfer learning CNN architectures—VGG19, VGG16, GoogLeNet, ResNet50, and DenseNet121—for multi-class brain tumor classification. The classification task involves four categories: No Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, Meningioma, and Glioma.

Experimental results demonstrate that VGG19 and VGG16 outperform other models, achieving an accuracy of 97%, indicating their suitability for MRI-based brain tumor classification.
