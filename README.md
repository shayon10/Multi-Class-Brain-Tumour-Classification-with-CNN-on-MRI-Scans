# **Brain Tumor Classification**

## **Acknowledgement**
This is the final project of the CSE438 (Digital Image Processing) course. This study has been published at the International Conference on Signal Processing, Information, Communication and Systems 2024 ([SPICSCON2024](https://spicscon.org/2024)) ([Document](https://doi.org/10.1109/SPICSCON64195.2024.10941675)). The study was supervised by Prof. [Dr. Ahmed Wasif Reza](https://fse.ewubd.edu/computer-science-engineering/faculty-view/wasif) and conducted by Nisarga Mridha (me), [Sofia Noor Rafa](https://github.com/sofiautilitarian), [Md. Siamul Islam Shayon](https://github.com/shayon10), and Nusrat Sultana.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project can be accessed from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset). It consists of MRI images of brain tumors categorized into classes for supervised learning.

## **Working Procedure**
This project focuses on a comparative analysis of five state-of-the-art deep learning models to classify brain tumors. The models evaluated are:

1. **VGG16**
2. **VGG19**
3. **GoogleNet**
4. **ResNet50**
5. **DenseNet121**

Each model's performance is evaluated based on key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## **Results**
